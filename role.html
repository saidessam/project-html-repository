<h2>The role of artificial intelligence in the face of Virus Corona</h2>
A joint team of researchers from King's College London and the Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as the health science company ZOE, have invented a new medical artificial intelligence technology that contributes to early detection of cases of the emerging COVID-19 virus.

According to sciencedaily.com, the new technology can solve the problem of the time required to perform traditional screening tests for suspected cases through the ability of artificial intelligence to determine the infected case based on symptoms only.

Professor Tim Spector, a member of the researchers' team, explained that the new AI technology can detect the infected cases by comparing the symptoms of people and the results of the tests of the new Corona virus (COVID-19).
